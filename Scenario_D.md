Dear Student,

I hope all is well.

We understand that you have expressed a desire to be reenrolled in AND101 after not submitting the required materials by the specified deadline. While we value your commitment to your education, I must inform you that reenrollment in the course is not possible especially no valid reason was given you missed the coursework.

To maintain the integrity of our academic processes and uphold fairness to all students, adherence to deadlines and requirements is of utmost importance. As such, we are unable to consider reenrollment to the course.

We are committed to every studentâ€™s learning experience so we encourage you to reenroll during the next course opening to continue your track.

Thank you for your understanding of our policies and your willingness to engage in this process. We are committed to fostering a productive learning environment and ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed.

Best regards,<br>
