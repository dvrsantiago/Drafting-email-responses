Dear Student,

I hope all is well. 

We appreciate your interest in CodePath and the time you've invested in applying to our organization. We assure you that we carefully reviewed your application.

We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission for the upcoming academic term. While we recognize your strong academic background and accomplishments, we have a specific policy of only accepting students who are enrolled at universities/colleges within the United States.

We understand that this news may be disappointing, and we want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. We encourage you to continue pursuing your academic and professional goals, and we sincerely wish you success in your future endeavors.

Kindly know that we are currently running classes in Haiti, and we used to run classes in Taiwan and we hope to expand our reach to other countries in the future, but we are not able to do so due to the current sponsorships we receive as non-profit organization. This restricts us to only accepting students who are currently enrolled in our partner Universities.

Thank you once again for considering CodePath. We appreciate the effort you put into your application.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please feel free to contact our admissions office.

Best regards,<br>
Dave
