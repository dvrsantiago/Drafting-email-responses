Dear Student,

I hope all is well.

We appreciate your interest in joining our **Summer Interview Prep course** and taking the time to apply for the course for the upcoming academic year.

We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission to the program for the current intake. Our admissions process is highly competitive, and unfortunately, your application was received after the deadline. As a result, we were not able to consider your application during our initial review.

We understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact application timelines, and we genuinely appreciate your enthusiasm to be a part of the Prep course. However, due to the large number of applicants and a significant waitlist for this program, we are unable to extend an offer of admission at this time.

We would like to share you this [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide) that you might find helpful. We encourage you to visit our resource page to learn more. We are also inviting you to sign up for our mailing list in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might find interesting.

Thank you once again for considering our Summer Interview Prep course. We appreciate your understanding and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

If you have any questions or require further assistance, please feel free to contact our admissions office.

Best regards,<br>
Dave
