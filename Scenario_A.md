Dear Student,

I hope all is well. 

Thank you for reaching out to us with your request to move to the Advanced Track. We appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication to your studies.

After careful consideration and review, we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your request to move to the Advanced Track at this time. Please understand that our decision is based on your pre-work score, and it only qualifies you for the **Intermediate Track**.

We believe that your success in mastering the earlier topics is of utmost importance, and we want to ensure that you have a strong foundation before progressing to the to a higher tier. Our aim is to provide all students with an enriching and supportive learning experience that aligns with their individual skill levels and aptitude.

We encourage you to continue putting in your best effort and engaging actively in the current track. This will undoubtedly contribute to your growth and readiness for future challenges. 

If you remain committed to the subject matter and exhibit consistent progress, there may be opportunities for you to explore advanced material in subsequent courses or semesters. We believe that each student should be placed in the proper track where the pre-work assessment has resulted to, and sometimes a slower pace can lead to a better foundation and long-term success.
